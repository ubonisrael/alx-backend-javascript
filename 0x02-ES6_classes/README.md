## Tasks
0. You used to attend a place like this at some point
Implement a class named ClassRoom:
```
Prototype: export default class ClassRoom
```
It should accept one attribute named maxStudentsSize (Number) and assigned to _maxStudentsSize

File: 0-classroom.js
 

1. Let's make some classrooms
Import the ClassRoom class from 0-classroom.js.
Implement a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).
File: 1-make_classrooms.js
 

2. A Course, Getters, and Setters
Implement a class named HolbertonCourse:
- Constructor attributes:
    - name (String)
    - length (Number)
    - students (array of Strings)
- Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
File: 2-hbtn_course.js
 

3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY
Implement a class named Currency:
- Constructor attributes:
    - code (String)
    - name (String)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
- Implement a method named displayFullCurrency that will return the attributes in the following format name (code).
File: 3-currency.js


4. Pricing
Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js
Implement a class named Pricing:
- Constructor attributes:
    - amount (Number)
    - currency (Currency)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
- Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the following format amount currency_name (currency_code).
- Implement a static method named convertPrice. It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.
File: 4-pricing.js
 

5. A Building
Implement a class named Building:
- Constructor attributes:
    - sqft (Number)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- Implement a getter for each attribute.
- Consider this class as an abstract class. And make sure that any class that extends from it should implement a method named evacuationWarningMessage.
- If a class that extends from it does not have a evacuationWarningMessage method, throw an error with the message Class extending Building must override evacuationWarningMessage
File: 5-building.js
 

6. Inheritance
Import Building from 5-building.js.
Implement a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends from Building:
- Constructor attributes:
    - sqft (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class Building)
    - floors (Number)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- Implement a getter for each attribute.
- Override the method named evacuationWarningMessage and return the following string Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors.
File: 6-sky_high.js
 

7. Airport
Implement a class named Airport:
- Constructor attributes:
- name (String)
- code (String)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- The default string description of the class should return the airport code (example below).
File: 7-airport.js
 

8. Primitive - Holberton Class
Implement a class named HolbertonClass:
- Constructor attributes:
    - size (Number)
    - location (String)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
- When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
- When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.
File: 8-hbtn_class.js
 

9. Hoisting
Fix this code and make it work.
```
const class2019 = new HolbertonClass(2019, 'San Francisco');
const class2020 = new HolbertonClass(2020, 'San Francisco');

export class HolbertonClass {
  constructor(year, location) {
    this._year = year;
    this._location = location;
  }

  get year() {
    return this._year;
  }

  get location() {
    return this._location;
  }
}

const student1 = new StudentHolberton('Guillaume', 'Salva', class2020);
const student2 = new StudentHolberton('John', 'Doe', class2020);
const student3 = new StudentHolberton('Albert', 'Clinton', class2019);
const student4 = new StudentHolberton('Donald', 'Bush', class2019);
const student5 = new StudentHolberton('Jason', 'Sandler', class2019);

export class StudentHolberton {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
    this._holbertonClass = holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  get holbertonClass() {
    return this.holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullStudentDescription() {
    return `${self._firstName} ${self._lastName} - ${self._holbertonClass.year} - ${self._holbertonClass.location}`;
  }
}


export const listOfStudents = [student1, student2, student3, student4, student5];
```
Result:
```
bob@dylan:~$ cat 9-main.js
import listOfStudents from "./9-hoisting.js";

console.log(listOfStudents);

const listPrinted = listOfStudents.map(
    student => student.fullStudentDescription
);

console.log(listPrinted)

Implement a class named Car:
- Constructor attributes:
    - brand (String)
    - motor (String)
    - color (String)
- Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
